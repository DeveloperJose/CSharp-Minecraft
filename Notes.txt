-I use the following dimensions
	X = Width
	Y = Length
	Z = Depth / 3D Height

	-That means that X and Y will always affect 2D movement while Z will be used for the depth (3D)
	
-XNA switches Y and Z, so when rendering we must do a switch. We can differentiate this because Vector3 will be used for XNA and Vector3I will be used for the client.

-The Empty project is needed so I can compile Content to XNB format (Which is needed to be able to load the Content to the game)

-If you need to re-create the content you need to compile the Content project and then copy the .xnb files to the Content folder in the JClient directory.
